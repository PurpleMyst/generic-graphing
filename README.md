# Generic Graphing

This is a generic grapher that can graph arbitrary two-variable equations, with
user-defined constants.

# Usage

Create a folder and copy over the graph.css file and the graph.js file, then
modify one of the two provided examples to your liking.

# Why?

My dear friend [Akuli](https://github.com/Akuli) is writing a math tutorial
with different kinds of graphs, such as lines, parabolas, etc...

Rather than write a separate webpage for each of those, I decided to just make
a library that can graph arbitrary equations.
