# Generic Graphing

This is a generic grapher that can graph arbitrary two-variable equations, with
user-defined constants.

# Usage

Create a folder and copy over the graph.css file and the graph.js file, then
modify one of the two provided examples to your liking.

# Why?

My dear friend [Akuli](https://github.com/Akuli) is writing a math tutorial
with different kinds of graphs, such as lines, parabolas, etc...

Rather than write a separate webpage for each of those, I decided to just make
a library that can graph arbitrary equations.

# What's missing?

In the non-generic version that I made before, it displayed the equation that
was being graphed in the top left. You can notice this is absent in this
version, and I'm not sure how to draw an arbitrary formula without adding
another user-inputted function for converting the formula to a string.
